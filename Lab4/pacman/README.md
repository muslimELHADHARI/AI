# Pacman Game with Informed Search Algorithms

A modern Pacman game built with Next.js, featuring a clean GUI and implementations of advanced search algorithms: RBFS (Recursive Best-First Search), IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*), and SMA* (Simplified Memory-bounded A*). The game visualizes path-finding processes and provides an interactive UI for algorithm selection.

## Project Structure

### Game Components
- **Pacman Character**: The player-controlled character navigating the maze.
- **Ghosts**: AI-controlled adversaries chasing Pacman.
- **Maze/Grid**: The game board layout with walls and paths.
- **Pellets/Dots**: Collectible items Pacman aims to gather.
- **Power Pellets**: Special items granting temporary advantages.
- **Score Display**: UI element showing the player's score.
- **Algorithm Selection UI**: Interface for choosing the path-finding algorithm.

### Algorithms
- **RBFS**: Recursive Best-First Search for efficient path optimization.
- **IDA***: Iterative Deepening A* for memory-efficient heuristic search.
- **SMA***: Simplified Memory-bounded A* for constrained environments.

## Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for responsive and modern styling.
- **UI Design**: Clean, high-contrast interface for better visibility.
- **shadcn/ui**: Leveraged for reusable, accessible UI components.

## Game Mechanics
- **Pacman Movement**: Uses the selected algorithm (RBFS, IDA*, or SMA*) to find optimal paths to pellets.
- **Ghost Behavior**: Employs simpler algorithms to pursue Pacman.
- **Visualization**: Displays the path-finding process for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pacman-game
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Usage
- Select an algorithm from the UI to control Pacman's path-finding.
- Navigate the maze, collect pellets, and avoid ghosts.
- Observe the visualized paths generated by the chosen algorithm.
- Monitor your score and game progress.
