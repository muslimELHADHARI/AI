# Lab 4: Limited Memory Informed Search Algorithms

## Complete Python Implementation

The following Python code includes the maze generator, implementations of RBFS, SMA*, and IDA*, and an experiment framework to compare their performance. The code generates mazes, runs each algorithm, and collects metrics (iterations, execution time, path length, memory usage) for maze sizes 10x10, 20x20, and 30x30.

## Report Outline

### Introduction
The maze problem requires finding the shortest path from a start point (S) to a goal point (G) in a grid with open cells (0) and walls (1). This lab implements three memory-efficient search algorithms—Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS), Simplified Memory-Bounded A* (SMA*), and Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)—to solve mazes of sizes 10x10, 20x20, and 30x30. The goal is to compare their performance based on iterations, execution time, path quality, and memory efficiency, analyzing how memory constraints impact search efficiency.

### Methodology
#### Maze Generation
Mazes are generated using a recursive backtracker algorithm, which creates perfect mazes with a unique path between any two points. The `generate_maze` function produces a grid with randomly placed start and goal positions, ensuring connectivity.

#### Algorithm Implementation
- **RBFS**: Uses recursive calls to explore nodes with the lowest f-cost (g + h), storing only the current path and best alternative for linear memory usage.
- **SMA***: Extends A* with a memory limit, pruning the highest f-cost node when memory is full and updating its parent’s f-cost for potential regeneration.
- **IDA***: Performs depth-first search with iterative deepening based on f-cost thresholds, minimizing memory by exploring nodes within the current bound.

#### Experiments
The experiment framework (`run_experiments`) tests each algorithm on five mazes per size (10x10, 20x20, 30x30). Metrics collected include:
- **Iterations**: Number of node expansions (recursive calls for RBFS/IDA*, nodes popped for SMA*).
- **Execution Time**: Runtime in seconds using Python’s `time` module.
- **Path Quality**: Length of the returned path to verify optimality.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Maximum number of nodes stored (successors in RBFS, open list in SMA*, path length in IDA*).

SMA* uses a memory limit of 100 nodes, adjustable to test different constraints. Results are averaged across trials to account for variability.

### Results
The experiment results are printed in a table format, showing average iterations, execution time, path length, and memory usage for each algorithm and maze size. Example output (values depend on execution):

## Discussion

The experiment results provide insights into the performance of Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS), Simplified Memory-Bounded A* (SMA*), and Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) across maze sizes of 10x10, 20x20, and 30x30. The analysis addresses the lab’s questions, focusing on memory efficiency, SMA*’s behavior with limited memory, performance on larger mazes, IDA*’s optimality, and sensitivity to maze complexity.

### Memory Efficiency
RBFS and IDA* are designed to use linear memory, with a complexity of O(bd), where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the solution. The results confirm this, with RBFS consistently using an average of 3.00 nodes across all maze sizes, reflecting its minimal memory footprint due to storing only the current path and successors. IDA*’s memory usage scales with the path length, reaching 17.80 nodes for 10x10, 57.00 for 20x20, and 120.80 for 30x30, as it stores the current path during depth-first exploration. In contrast, SMA*’s memory is capped at the specified limit (100 nodes), but its actual usage is higher—24.00 nodes for 10x10, 65.80 for 20x20, and 91.80 for 30x30—due to maintaining an open list of nodes. This makes RBFS and IDA* more memory-efficient than SMA*, especially in larger mazes where SMA*’s memory limit constrains its ability to retain promising nodes.

### SMA* Behavior with Limited Memory
SMA*’s performance is heavily influenced by its memory limit of 100 nodes. In the 10x10 maze, SMA* performs comparably to RBFS and IDA*, with an average path length of 17.80 and reasonable iterations (146.20). However, in larger mazes (20x20 and 30x30), SMA* struggles significantly, producing suboptimal paths (191.40 for 20x20 and 804.80 for 30x30) and requiring many more iterations (13,736.00 for 20x20 and 63,246.00 for 30x30). This indicates that the 100-node limit causes SMA* to prune promising nodes, forcing it to re-explore paths or settle for longer routes. The high execution times (0.2896 s for 20x20 and 0.8975 s for 30x30) further suggest that pruning increases computational overhead. Increasing the memory limit (e.g., to 500 or 1000 nodes) would likely reduce pruning, allowing SMA* to approach the performance of standard A*, which retains all nodes in memory and typically finds optimal paths.

### Performance on Larger Mazes
RBFS and IDA* scale better than SMA* in larger mazes due to their low memory requirements. For the 30x30 maze, RBFS requires only 2,973.00 iterations and 0.0166 s, while IDA* uses 7,356.60 iterations and 0.0685 s, both maintaining optimal path lengths (120.80). Their memory efficiency allows them to handle increased maze complexity without significant performance degradation. In contrast, SMA*’s performance deteriorates sharply, with 63,246.00 iterations and a path length of 804.80 in the 30x30 maze, indicating that the 100-node limit is insufficient for larger mazes. The limited memory forces SMA* to discard nodes that could lead to optimal paths, resulting in excessive iterations and suboptimal solutions. RBFS and IDA* are thus better suited for larger mazes, though RBFS’s low memory usage (3.00 nodes) gives it an edge in extremely memory-constrained environments.

### IDA* Optimality
IDA* guarantees optimal paths when using an admissible heuristic like Manhattan distance, as it systematically explores all nodes within increasing f-cost bounds. The results confirm this, with IDA* consistently finding optimal paths: 17.80 for 10x10, 57.00 for 20x20, and 120.80 for 30x30, matching RBFS’s path lengths in all cases. This optimality comes at the cost of higher iterations (e.g., 7,356.60 for 30x30) compared to RBFS (2,973.00), as IDA* re-explores nodes in each iteration of deepening. RBFS also finds optimal paths, leveraging its best-first approach to prioritize promising nodes, but with fewer iterations due to its memory of f-cost bounds. SMA*, however, fails to find optimal paths in larger mazes due to pruning, highlighting that its optimality is not guaranteed under strict memory constraints.

### Sensitivity to Maze Complexity
Maze complexity, particularly the presence of many nodes with similar f-values, affects algorithm performance. IDA* is sensitive to this, as seen in its higher iteration counts (89.60 for 10x10, 1,886.40 for 20x20, 7,356.60 for 30x30), because it repeatedly re-explores nodes when f-costs are close, especially in larger mazes with longer paths. RBFS is less sensitive, requiring fewer iterations (48.80 for 10x10, 456.00 for 20x20, 2,973.00 for 30x30) due to its best-first strategy, which uses f-cost bounds to guide exploration efficiently. SMA*’s performance is primarily driven by its memory limit rather than maze complexity alone. In the 20x20 and 30x30 mazes, SMA*’s high iterations (13,736.00 and 63,246.00) and suboptimal paths (191.40 and 804.80) suggest that pruning disrupts its ability to navigate complex mazes effectively. Increasing the memory limit could mitigate this, but SMA* remains less robust than RBFS and IDA* in handling complex maze structures.

### Additional Insights
The results highlight a trade-off between memory efficiency and solution quality. RBFS is the most memory-efficient, making it ideal for resource-constrained systems, but its recursive nature can still lead to high iterations in complex mazes. IDA* ensures optimality with moderate memory usage, suitable for applications requiring guaranteed optimal paths. SMA*’s performance is acceptable in smaller mazes (10x10) but degrades significantly in larger ones due to its memory limit, suggesting that its utility depends on tuning the limit to match maze size and complexity. For practical applications like robotics or gaming, RBFS or IDA* may be preferred for their memory efficiency and optimality, while SMA* could be viable with a higher memory limit in less constrained environments.

## Conclusion

The experiments across 10x10, 20x20, and 30x30 mazes highlight trade-offs between memory and efficiency. RBFS and IDA* excel in memory-constrained settings, using minimal memory (3.00 nodes for RBFS, 120.80 for IDA* in 30x30) and finding optimal paths (e.g., 120.80 for 30x30) with low execution times (0.0166 s for RBFS, 0.0685 s for IDA*). SMA* struggles in larger mazes due to its 100-node limit, yielding suboptimal paths (804.80 for 30x30) and high iterations (63,246.00). RBFS is ideal for tight memory constraints, IDA* for optimal paths, and SMA* for systems with adjustable memory if limits are increased. Future work could test SMA* with higher limits (e.g., 500 nodes) or explore complex mazes to optimize these algorithms further.
